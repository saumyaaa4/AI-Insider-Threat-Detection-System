# 🔐 AI-Powered Insider Threat Detection System

## 📌 Overview

The AI-Powered Insider Threat Detection System is an industry-level cybersecurity project designed to detect malicious insider activities using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and behavioral analytics.

This system analyzes employee activity patterns such as login behavior, file access frequency, data downloads, and device usage to identify suspicious or abnormal actions that may indicate insider threats.

This project simulates real-world enterprise security monitoring systems used by organizations to protect sensitive data.
